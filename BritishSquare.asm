# Description:  This file implements the 2-player game British Square. 
#		The game entails two players alternating turns to drop 
# 		stones on the board. The overall objective is to have 
#		the most stones in the game. The game ends when neither
#		player can make a legal drop. A drop is only legal if 
#		there are no enemy stones orthogonally adjacent to the
#		desired empty cell.
